Got it. I‚Äôll draft professional, copy-and-paste ready response templates that you can reuse when documenting or responding to non-malicious activity in your SecOps role. Each template will include placeholders for username, hostname, timeframe, and IOC values so you can quickly adjust them.
üîπ 1. Non-Malicious Inbound Activity ‚Äì False Positive
[Case Summary]  
Inbound activity detected from [SOURCE_IP/DOMAIN] targeting [HOSTNAME] at [TIMEFRAME]. Upon review, the activity was identified as non-malicious.

[Analysis]  
- Source IP/domain is associated with routine [scanner/service/provider].  
- No evidence of exploitation attempts or suspicious follow-on activity.  
- Logs show normal response behavior with no persistence, execution, or data exfiltration.  

[Conclusion]  
This event has been determined to be a false positive, resulting from normal background internet noise/inbound scans. No further action required at this time.  

[Recommendation]  
Continue monitoring, but no escalation is necessary unless repeated with anomalous behavior.
üîπ 2. Non-Malicious Scheduled Task
[Case Summary]  
A scheduled task was detected on [HOSTNAME] under user [USERNAME] at [TIMEFRAME].

[Analysis]  
- Task corresponds to routine system/application maintenance (e.g., updates, software checks, backup jobs).  
- Binary executed is signed/legitimate and located in a trusted path.  
- No correlation with suspicious command-line arguments or malicious persistence techniques.  

[Conclusion]  
The scheduled task activity is non-malicious and aligned with expected system behavior.  

[Recommendation]  
Document as expected behavior. No additional action required.
üîπ 3. Non-Malicious Failed Login Attempts
[Case Summary]  
Multiple failed login attempts observed for [USERNAME] on [HOSTNAME] between [START_TIME] and [END_TIME].

[Analysis]  
- Attempts originate from a known, internal IP/device used by the account owner.  
- Review indicates mistyped password and subsequent successful login.  
- No brute force or lateral movement behavior observed.  

[Conclusion]  
Failed login attempts were user-generated and non-malicious.  

[Recommendation]  
No escalation required. Advise user to ensure password accuracy and confirm MFA is functioning.
üîπ 4. Non-Malicious URI Detection
[Case Summary]  
A URI request to [URI/DOMAIN] was flagged by security tools on [HOSTNAME] at [TIMEFRAME].

[Analysis]  
- Review of threat intelligence sources indicates the URI/domain is benign.  
- URI is associated with [application/software update/ad service/known business tool].  
- No malicious content or payload was delivered.  

[Conclusion]  
This detection is a false positive. URI is non-malicious and does not indicate compromise.  

[Recommendation]  
Close as informational. No further remediation is needed.
‚ú® Tip: You can keep these in a ‚ÄúResponse Snippets‚Äù notepad and just replace [USERNAME], [HOSTNAME], [TIMEFRAME], [URI], etc.
Would you like me to also combine these into one master template with dropdown options (like checkboxes for false positive categories) so you can standardize all your copy/paste reports even more?
