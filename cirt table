| **Alert Name** | 90 CIRT IP Lookup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Purpose**    | Verify the legitimacy of IP addresses identified as potentially malicious by Recorded Future and VirusTotal.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Summary**    | The alert triggered after inbound IPs with elevated threat reputations were observed communicating with internal assets. The detection prompted correlation and validation to determine whether the IPs belong to approved penetration testing ranges, whitelisted infrastructure, or represent true adversarial activity. |
| **Action**     | CIRT was requested to review and confirm whether the IPs are authorized. If not whitelisted or part of a sanctioned test, a block request will be issued to prevent further connections.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Outcome**    | Awaiting CIRT verification and, if warranted, implementation of network-wide block actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Alert Name** | Automated IP Block (Real-Time Detection)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Purpose**    | Enforce automated blocking for malicious IPs detected in real time, strengthening proactive network defense.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Summary**    | Automation continuously monitors network telemetry and Recorded Future threat feeds for high-confidence indicators. When malicious IPs are identified, the system automatically generates a block request to CIRT, ensuring rapid containment and reduced dwell time. |
| **Action**     | Confirmed malicious IPs are blocked across perimeter defenses and logged for retrospective analysis. Repeated or correlated detections are immediately contained with minimal analyst intervention.                                                                   |
| **Outcome**    | Real-time automated blocking workflow deployed, reducing manual triage time and improving incident response efficiency.                                                                                                                                               |

| **Alert Name** | Malicious Attack String Detection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Purpose**    | Identify and escalate detections containing suspicious or malicious command strings observed in network or endpoint telemetry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Summary**    | The alert was triggered after identifying activity containing known malicious or encoded command strings commonly associated with exploitation or command execution attempts. These strings often align with MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as **T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**, **T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information)**, and **T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer)**. Correlation with **Recorded Future** and **VirusTotal** confirmed elevated threat reputation and potential adversarial behavior. |
| **Action**     | CIRT was notified to review the decoded string data and determine if the activity corresponds to legitimate administrative actions, authorized testing, or an active threat. If verified as malicious, network containment and IOC blocking will be initiated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Outcome**    | Pending CIRT review and final determination. If validated as malicious, mitigation actions will include blocking at perimeter controls and retroactive correlation across historical telemetry for related indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
