Perfect — this will be a Detection Engineering Mastery Plan (60 days) tailored for you as a working detection engineer aiming to become fluent in Splunk (SPL), KQL, and YARA-L for Google SecOps.
The plan is practical — 60–90 minutes a day, 5–6 days a week — and everything builds on your real job context (alert tuning, correlation logic, log field analysis).
🧭 60-Day Detection Engineering Mastery Plan
Goal: Full proficiency in SPL, KQL, and YARA-L — able to build, optimize, and translate detections across platforms.
Tools: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Google SecOps (Chronicle).
Focus Areas: Syntax → Correlation → Attack Detection → Optimization.
📆 PHASE 1 — Foundation & Syntax Mastery (Days 1–14)
Goal: Understand the structure, commands, and data logic of each language.
Week 1 – SPL Core
Topics:
search, stats, tstats, eval, where, table
Indexes, sourcetypes, and accelerated data models
Daily Tasks:
Day	Focus
1	Review SPL basics (search, fields, table, where)
2	Practice stats and tstats on sample datasets
3	Write 3 queries: top processes, failed logins, large outbound data
4	Learn eval, case(), and if() logic
5	Study regex and match() examples
6	Build a simple detection: “Multiple failed logins followed by success”
7	Recap and document syntax patterns
Output:
Create a personal SPL Cheatsheet.md on GitHub.
Week 2 – KQL Core
Topics:
project, extend, summarize, join, arg_max
Tables, schemas, and time windows
Daily Tasks:
Day	Focus
8	Understand the data structure (SecurityEvent, DeviceProcessEvents)
9	Recreate your SPL queries in KQL
10	Use summarize by, count(), dcount(), bin()
11	Learn join and union across tables
12	Build 3 detections: new admin accounts, PowerShell, lateral movement
13	Write comments + test performance
14	Review and summarize learnings
Output:
Create a KQL Translation Notebook with 10 SPL → KQL equivalents.
⚙️ PHASE 2 — Correlation & Field Mastery (Days 15–35)
Goal: Understand field mapping, normalization, and multi-event correlation.
Week 3 – Field Awareness & Normalization
Day	Focus
15	Compare Splunk CIM vs. Microsoft ASIM vs. Chronicle UDM
16	Identify common fields: principal.user, process.name, network.ip
17	Map your own environment logs to UDM equivalents
18	Practice rewriting field logic across all 3 languages
19	Study metadata.event_type, target.process.name, principal.hostname
20	Write 5 test detections with real field names
21	Review field usage patterns
Output:
Create a Field Mapping Table.md (CIM → ASIM → UDM).
Week 4 – YARA-L Fundamentals
Topics:
rule, meta, events, condition
$variables, within, count(), and/or/not
Day	Focus
22	Learn rule structure and keywords
23	Write your first 3 rules: login, process, network
24	Add count() and within logic
25	Practice correlating $process and $network
26	Study real examples from Chronicle documentation
27	Build detection: login → PowerShell within 10m
28	Recap and document syntax
Output:
Create a YARA-L Field Reference.md and save your 5 working rules.
🔬 PHASE 3 — Detection Engineering Deep Dive (Days 36–52)
Goal: Build enterprise-level detections, link them to MITRE, and test optimization.
Week 5 – MITRE ATT&CK Implementations
Day	Focus
29	Study MITRE T1059 (Command Execution)
30	Build detections in SPL, KQL, YARA-L
31	Study T1078 (Valid Accounts)
32	Implement login correlation rules
33	Study T1047 (WMIC, Scheduled Task)
34	Write correlation detections in all 3
35	Review and benchmark detection logic
Output:
Commit 9 total detections (3 techniques × 3 languages).
Week 6 – Optimization & False Positive Tuning
Day	Focus
36	Learn SPL summariesonly=true, acceleration
37	Use KQL summarize hint.shufflekey
38	Learn YARA-L performance best practices
39	Test tuning parameters and whitelists
40	Build exclusion logic (safe processes/users)
41	Validate results on simulated data
42	Document lessons learned
Output:
Build a Detection Optimization Guide.md for all three platforms.
🚀 PHASE 4 — Expert Translation & Automation (Days 53–60)
Goal: Write like a senior detection engineer — optimized, correlated, modular detections.
Day	Focus
53	Build a cross-language “detection pack” (same ATT&CK coverage, 3 syntaxes)
54	Automate query testing via notebooks or scripts
55	Optimize rule metadata and structure
56	Add version control on GitHub
57	Write correlation rule: login → process → exfil (multi-event chain)
58	Review YARA-L advanced logic (exists(), nested count())
59	Peer-review or self-critique your rules
60	Final project: Build 3 enterprise-ready detections, all languages, all tested
Output:
✅ A polished GitHub portfolio:
/splunk/ (10+ rules)
/kql/ (10+ rules)
/yara-l/ (10+ rules)
/docs/ (cheatsheets + mappings)
💡 After Day 60
You’ll be able to:
Design detections that correlate across users, hosts, and time windows.
Port rules instantly between Splunk, Sentinel, and Chronicle.
Understand YARA-L field hierarchies and confidently use $process, $principal, $metadata.
Tune false positives efficiently.
