# Detection Development Playbook

This document outlines my process for developing, testing, and deploying detection rules.

1. Understand the threat behavior and tactics.
2. Identify relevant log sources and fields.
3. Write detection queries focusing on high fidelity and low false positives.
4. Validate detections against real or simulated data.
5. Tune and iterate based on feedback.
6. Document and map to MITRE ATT&CK.
