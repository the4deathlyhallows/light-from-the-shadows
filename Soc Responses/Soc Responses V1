ðŸ”¹ Non-Malicious Inbound Activity â€“ False Positive
During the review of inbound activity from [SOURCE_IP/DOMAIN] to [HOSTNAME] around [TIMEFRAME], we determined that the traffic was non-malicious. The activity was consistent with routine internet scanning and did not include any attempts at exploitation or follow-on actions. System responses appeared normal, and no persistence, execution, or exfiltration was identified. Based on this, the alert is considered a false positive, and no further action is required aside from routine monitoring.
ðŸ”¹ Non-Malicious Scheduled Task
An alert was triggered for a scheduled task on [HOSTNAME] under the account [USERNAME] at [TIMEFRAME]. After investigation, it was confirmed that this task is tied to normal system or application maintenance, such as updates or backup processes. The binaries involved were verified as legitimate, signed, and located in trusted paths. There was no indication of malicious behavior or persistence techniques. This activity is considered expected behavior and does not require escalation.
ðŸ”¹ Non-Malicious Failed Login Attempts
We observed multiple failed login attempts for [USERNAME] on [HOSTNAME] between [START_TIME] and [END_TIME]. Analysis showed that the attempts originated from the userâ€™s normal device and were followed by a successful login, indicating that the failures were due to incorrect password entry rather than brute force or malicious activity. There was no evidence of lateral movement or compromise. This appears to be user error, and no further action is needed beyond reminding the user to double-check password entry and ensure MFA is working properly.
ðŸ”¹ Non-Malicious URI Detection
A URI request to [URI/DOMAIN] on [HOSTNAME] at [TIMEFRAME] was flagged by security tools, but further investigation showed that the domain is benign. The traffic was tied to a legitimate service/application and did not deliver any malicious payloads. There was no evidence of compromise or suspicious follow-up activity. This detection is considered a false positive, and no remediation is necessary.
