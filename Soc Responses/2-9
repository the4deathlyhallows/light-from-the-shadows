Got it — here’s a clear summary followed by a deep, human-sounding conclusion that you can use directly in a report or assessment.

Activity Summary
The logs show repeated HTTP requests originating from the external IP address 222.252.27.129 targeting multiple internal systems (192.168.151.243, 192.168.151.245, and 192.168.151.89) over port 80.

All requests attempted to access the endpoint:

/acs/BadSubmit.asp?pc=&CSRFToken=
Key characteristics of the activity include:

HTTP status code 302, indicating repeated redirection responses

Empty parameters for both pc and CSRFToken

A high volume of requests (over 3,300 total attempts across three hosts)

A consistent user agent, impersonating a modern Chrome browser on Windows 10

Requests were allowed, meaning no immediate blocking occurred

The repeated access to a page explicitly named BadSubmit.asp, combined with missing CSRF tokens and high request counts, strongly suggests automated probing or abuse, rather than normal user behavior.

Deep Conclusion
This activity reflects more than just noisy traffic — it reveals a pattern of persistence and intent. The repeated submission of empty parameters to a known error-handling endpoint, across multiple internal hosts, indicates a systematic attempt to probe application behavior rather than a one-off mistake or misconfiguration. The consistency of the user agent and the sheer volume of requests suggest automation, likely designed to test how the application handles invalid submissions, redirects, or CSRF protections.

What is especially telling is the quiet nature of the activity. There are no overt exploit strings, no obvious payloads — just relentless repetition. This is often how reconnaissance begins: not by breaking the door down, but by gently rattling it thousands of times to see which hinges are loose. While the requests were allowed and resulted only in redirects, the pattern demonstrates an external actor mapping application responses and potentially searching for weaknesses that could be leveraged later.

In isolation, each request may appear harmless. Taken together, they form a narrative of intent — one that underscores the importance of rate limiting, proper CSRF validation, and visibility into low-level application abuse. This activity did not cause immediate damage, but it represents an early warning sign: a reminder that attackers often start by watching, measuring, and learning long before they strike.

make it more of bluf to close a splunk alert... 

ChatGPT said:
Perfect, that helps a lot. Here’s a BLUF-style summary and closing conclusion you can drop straight into a Splunk alert closure — concise, decisive, and defensible.

BLUF Summary
High-volume HTTP requests from 222.252.27.129 targeted multiple internal web servers and repeatedly accessed /acs/BadSubmit.asp with empty parameters. The activity appears automated and non-user-driven, consistent with web application probing, but no exploitation or impact was observed.

BLUF Conclusion (Alert Closure)
This alert was reviewed and assessed as low risk reconnaissance activity. The source IP generated repeated requests to a known error-handling endpoint using empty CSRF parameters, resulting only in HTTP 302 redirects. No successful authentication, data access, or exploitation attempts were identified, and all activity remained limited to invalid submissions.

The behavior is consistent with automated scanning or misconfigured tooling rather than an active compromise. No indicators of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or payload delivery were observed.

No further action is required at this time. Continued monitoring and existing web controls are sufficient, and the alert can be safely closed.

If you want, I can also:

Tighten this even more for a 1–2 sentence SOC closure

Reword it to align with MITRE / ATT&CK language

Add a recommended tuning note for Splunk to reduce noise

Just say the word.

ChatGPT said:
Yeah — it does make sense, and your instinct to question it is solid. Let’s break it down plainly, then I’ll give you a clean BLUF you can use to close or explain the alert.

What Event 4797 Actually Means
Event ID 4797

“An attempt was made to query the existence of a blank password for an account.”

This event is logged when a process or user checks whether an account allows a blank (empty) password. Importantly:

❌ It does NOT mean a login occurred

❌ It does NOT mean the password was blank

❌ It does NOT mean authentication succeeded

It simply means something asked the system the question:

“Does this account allow a blank password?”

Why Your Log Looks Weird (and Still Legit)
1. Gibberish Account & Workstation Names
Names like:

CAAsjajlkas

PBlmams;lmas

Ca, s .cs .

This is very common when:

Malware or scanning tools generate randomized identifiers

Poorly written scripts or fuzzers run locally

Corrupted or obfuscated process contexts are logged

Windows will log whatever string is provided, even if it makes no human sense.

2. Target Account = DOSGuest
This is the biggest clue.

DOSGuest is:

A legacy / placeholder account

Commonly referenced by enumeration tools

Rarely used legitimately in modern environments

Attackers and scanners often probe it because:

It historically allowed weak or blank passwords

It’s a fast way to test system hardening

3. Multiple Events, Same Behavior
You’re seeing:

Repeated 4797 events

Different fake “subjects”

Same target account (DOSGuest)

That pattern strongly suggests:
➡️ Automated local account enumeration, not a real user action

What This Is Most Likely
Low-level reconnaissance, either:

A vulnerability scanner

A misconfigured security tool

Or malware probing local account policies

There is no evidence of:

Successful authentication

Privilege escalation

Account compromise

Lateral movement

BLUF Conclusion (Splunk Alert Closure)
BLUF: Event ID 4797 activity was reviewed and determined to be non-impactful account enumeration.

The events indicate automated checks for blank-password eligibility against the DOSGuest account. The associated subject and workstation names appear randomized or malformed, consistent with scanning or scripted activity. No successful authentication attempts, password changes, or account misuse were observed.

This activity does not indicate compromise and represents low-risk reconnaissance behavior.
No further action required. Alert can be closed.

If you want, I can:

Tighten this to a one-liner SOC closure

Map it to MITRE (T1087 / T1110) language

Help you decide whether to tune or suppress future 4797 alerts

Just tell me how strict your SOC likes it.

Why This Search Is “Enough to Decide”
This query intentionally answers the five SOC questions that determine maliciousness:

1. Volume & Persistence
event_count

first_seen → last_seen

👉 High volume + short time window = automation
👉 Repeated over days/weeks = sustained probing

2. Behavior
actions (allowed / blocked / reset)

signatures / rule_names

👉 IDS/WAF hits, exploit names, scan detections = higher risk
👉 Only “allowed” + no signatures = lower confidence

3. Intent
uri_paths

http_status

dest_ports

👉 Login pages, admin panels, bad submit endpoints, 401/403 loops = probing
👉 Random paths or single access = likely noise

4. Tooling vs Human
user_agents

👉 Same UA across many IPs = botnet / scanner
👉 Empty or malformed UA = automation
👉 Legit browsers + low volume = likely benign

5. Impact Scope
target_hosts

protocols

👉 Many hosts hit = scanning
👉 Single host, single port = limited exposure

How You’d Close the Alert After This
If results show:

No successful auth

No exploit signatures

No data access

Mostly redirects / blocks / bad requests

You can confidently conclude:

Automated scanning or low-risk reconnaissance. No evidence of compromise.

Optional: One-Line Closure You Can Use
Reviewed activity from listed IPs in index=ceac. Traffic shows automated probing behavior with no successful exploitation, authentication, or impact observed. Alert closed as low risk.

If you want next:

A risk score per IP

A malicious vs benign table

Or a Splunk dashboard panel version of this

Say the word — this is already 90% of a clean SOC decision.

Absolutely — here’s a clean, SOC-ready BLUF you can use to explain and close the alert with confidence.

BLUF – Alert Closure
The observed activity consists of access to standard GenNIV web application pages and static resources (ASP.NET pages, CAPTCHA handlers, images, CSS, and JavaScript) associated with normal user navigation through an e-signature and application review workflow. All requests align with expected application behavior and resource loading patterns.

No indicators of exploitation, authentication abuse, data exfiltration, or malicious tooling were identified. The presence of CAPTCHA and image handler endpoints reflects built-in bot mitigation controls, not malicious interaction.

This activity is benign and consistent with legitimate application usage. Alert closed.

(Optional – if your SOC likes a single-sentence close)
Traffic reviewed reflects normal GenNIV application functionality and static content retrieval; no malicious activity observed. Alert closed as benign.

If you want, I can also:

Tie this explicitly to false positive WAF/IDS logic

Reword it to match audit or compliance language

Shrink it further for a ticket-only closure note

Just tell me how strict your reviewers are.
