CIRT Brief Report – Possible Malicious Activity

At [time/date], the alert [alert name] triggered on [hostname or user], flagging activity that looked out of the ordinary. The event involved [brief description – e.g., a PowerShell process launching with an encoded command or an external IP connection].

After reviewing the alert, I pulled related logs in [Splunk / Google SecOps / Sentinel] to see what else was happening around that time — including the parent process, command line arguments, and any outbound network connections. I also ran the hash, domain, and IP through VirusTotal, Recorded Future, and open-source sources to check for known reputation or threat history. The results showed [quick summary – e.g., the hash came back clean, but the IP had a few suspicious reports]. Screenshots of the alert details and reputation lookups are attached.

Based on what I found, my initial thought is that this could be [insert hypothesis – e.g., a legitimate admin script or potentially unauthorized script execution]. There are a few indicators that lean suspicious, but I can’t fully confirm without additional context.

Could CIRT please take a look and confirm whether this is expected activity for this host or user, or if we should treat it as potentially malicious and investigate further?
