The failed login attempts and subsequent locked account for npediscoveryoel are likely a result of a misconfiguration or automated process that triggered account lockout. This appears to be a false positive with no indication of malicious activity. The account is used for legitimate system discovery tasks, and the issue has been identified as a credential or configuration mismatch. No further action required at this time.

It sounds like you're reviewing security findings and are concerned about the possibility of false positives in relation to failed login attempts and locked accounts on RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) systems.

Here's why the findings might be considered false positives, particularly for the `npediscoveryoel` account:

### 1. **Automated or Service Accounts**:

* If `npediscoveryoel` is an automated service or an account used for system maintenance or discovery, it could be configured to attempt logins periodically. This can trigger failed login attempts, especially if there is a configuration or credential issue (e.g., expired password or misconfigured SSH keys).
* These accounts might have legitimate reasons for multiple failed login attempts (for example, scripted attempts to access a system with incorrect credentials or misconfigurations).

### 2. **Account Lockout Threshold Configuration**:

* RHEL typically has account lockout policies configured, which lock an account after a number of failed login attempts (such as `pam_tally` or `pam_tally2` for login tracking). If an account is locked after a certain threshold of failed attempts, it could indicate a misconfiguration or an issue with a legitimate account.
* If the account is meant to be used automatically, you may want to check if the lockout policy is incorrectly triggering for accounts that shouldn't be affected.

### 3. **User or Group Configuration**:

* If the account `npediscoveryoel` belongs to a group or is used in a particular way, there could be specific settings causing these failed attempts. For instance, if there was a temporary issue with a related service (e.g., NFS or a network mount) that caused multiple failed access attempts.
* Additionally, if there are recent changes to user permissions or group memberships, the account might be hitting a misconfiguration that triggers these failed logins.

### 4. **Timing and Frequency**:

* If the failed login attempts are spread out or happening over a longer period, it could indicate a pattern of an account trying to authenticate via incorrect credentials, which is different from a brute force attack or malicious activity.
* However, if the account is repeatedly locked out within a short time frame, it could indicate a configuration issue (e.g., an incorrect login attempt being retried automatically by a script or process).

### 5. **Unusual Activity Triggers**:

* Sometimes monitoring systems might report findings based on a simple rule of "X failed logins within Y minutes." If the rule is too aggressive or sensitive, it could incorrectly mark normal operations as a security issue. This is especially true if the `npediscoveryoel` account is running some kind of scheduled task or probe that could be misinterpreted as brute force or an attack.

### 6. **False Positive Due to Lack of Context**:

* Security systems can sometimes flag accounts for having multiple failed login attempts without fully understanding the context. If `npediscoveryoel` is a legitimate account used for system maintenance, the security tool might incorrectly flag these activities as malicious or suspicious without considering that this account might be frequently used for legitimate purposes.

### Steps to Verify:

1. **Review Logs**: Check logs (e.g., `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/auth.log`) for additional context around the failed login attempts. If the attempts seem legitimate (for example, from a known IP address or related to scheduled tasks), it may be a false positive.

2. **Check Account Activity**: Confirm whether `npediscoveryoel` is an automated service account or if it's being used for discovery tasks. Sometimes such accounts will generate failed logins due to incorrect configuration or credential issues.

3. **Look for Misconfigurations**: Check if there's any misconfiguration with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) settings or if there are incorrect credentials being used, particularly with SSH or sudoers configuration.

4. **Whitelist Known Accounts**: If you're confident that `npediscoveryoel` is a legitimate account, you could adjust your security settings to whitelist it or exclude it from triggering false positive alerts.

If you're managing security logs or investigating findings for compliance or monitoring, it's crucial to balance false positives with actual threats to ensure that resources are spent responding to real security issues rather than wasting time on configurations that are non-threatening.

Does any of this align with what you're seeing in your findings? If you need help with further investigation, feel free to share more specifics.
