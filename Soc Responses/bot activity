Got it — here’s a clear summary followed by a deep, human-sounding conclusion that you can use directly in a report or assessment.

Activity Summary
The logs show repeated HTTP requests originating from the external IP address 222.252.27.129 targeting multiple internal systems (192.168.151.243, 192.168.151.245, and 192.168.151.89) over port 80.

All requests attempted to access the endpoint:

/acs/BadSubmit.asp?pc=&CSRFToken=
Key characteristics of the activity include:

HTTP status code 302, indicating repeated redirection responses

Empty parameters for both pc and CSRFToken

A high volume of requests (over 3,300 total attempts across three hosts)

A consistent user agent, impersonating a modern Chrome browser on Windows 10

Requests were allowed, meaning no immediate blocking occurred

The repeated access to a page explicitly named BadSubmit.asp, combined with missing CSRF tokens and high request counts, strongly suggests automated probing or abuse, rather than normal user behavior.

Deep Conclusion
This activity reflects more than just noisy traffic — it reveals a pattern of persistence and intent. The repeated submission of empty parameters to a known error-handling endpoint, across multiple internal hosts, indicates a systematic attempt to probe application behavior rather than a one-off mistake or misconfiguration. The consistency of the user agent and the sheer volume of requests suggest automation, likely designed to test how the application handles invalid submissions, redirects, or CSRF protections.

What is especially telling is the quiet nature of the activity. There are no overt exploit strings, no obvious payloads — just relentless repetition. This is often how reconnaissance begins: not by breaking the door down, but by gently rattling it thousands of times to see which hinges are loose. While the requests were allowed and resulted only in redirects, the pattern demonstrates an external actor mapping application responses and potentially searching for weaknesses that could be leveraged later.

In isolation, each request may appear harmless. Taken together, they form a narrative of intent — one that underscores the importance of rate limiting, proper CSRF validation, and visibility into low-level application abuse. This activity did not cause immediate damage, but it represents an early warning sign: a reminder that attackers often start by watching, measuring, and learning long before they strike.

make it more of bluf to close a splunk alert...

Perfect, that helps a lot. Here’s a BLUF-style summary and closing conclusion you can drop straight into a Splunk alert closure — concise, decisive, and defensible.

BLUF Summary
High-volume HTTP requests from 222.252.27.129 targeted multiple internal web servers and repeatedly accessed /acs/BadSubmit.asp with empty parameters. The activity appears automated and non-user-driven, consistent with web application probing, but no exploitation or impact was observed.

BLUF Conclusion (Alert Closure)
This alert was reviewed and assessed as low risk reconnaissance activity. The source IP generated repeated requests to a known error-handling endpoint using empty CSRF parameters, resulting only in HTTP 302 redirects. No successful authentication, data access, or exploitation attempts were identified, and all activity remained limited to invalid submissions.

The behavior is consistent with automated scanning or misconfigured tooling rather than an active compromise. No indicators of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or payload delivery were observed.

No further action is required at this time. Continued monitoring and existing web controls are sufficient, and the alert can be safely closed.

If you want, I can also:

Tighten this even more for a 1–2 sentence SOC closure

Reword it to align with MITRE / ATT&CK language

Add a recommended tuning note for Splunk to reduce noise

Just say the word.
