# Light From The Shadows

Welcome to **Light From The Shadows**, my detection engineering portfolio dedicated to uncovering hidden threats lurking in the darkness. This repo showcases detection rules, enrichment scripts, and playbooks designed to bring light where cyber adversaries hide.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Detection Rules:** KQL, Splunk SPL, and Sigma queries targeting stealthy adversary behaviors.  
- **Enrichment Scripts:** Python tools to augment and automate threat detection workflows.  
- **Playbooks & Documentation:** My personal methodologies and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.

## Philosophy

Detection is about shining light in the darkest corners of your environment — catching what others miss by blending data, logic, and relentless curiosity.

> “From darkness comes clarity.”
