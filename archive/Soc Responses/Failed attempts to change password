🟢 Alert Disposition: Benign Positive 

Summary 
The alert was generated from failed password change attempts associated with the service accounts oracle, sn_disscan, and ivv_ansible on RHEL systems. 

Analysis Performed 

Reviewed 30-day historical activity for the impacted accounts 

Confirmed all accounts are non-interactive service accounts used for: 

Database services (oracle) 

Discovery/scanning operations (sn_disscan) 

Configuration management and automation (ivv_ansible) 

Observed activity was: 

Consistent over time 

Limited to expected hosts 

Initiated via expected binaries (passwd, chpasswd, usermod) 

Occurring at predictable intervals consistent with automation 

No evidence of: 

Lateral movement 

Privilege escalation 

Interactive login behavior 

New or anomalous hosts 

Conclusion 
The observed failures are consistent with expected service automation behavior and do not indicate malicious activity. 

Disposition 
✅ Benign Positive – No action required 

Recommendations 

Continue monitoring for behavioral drift (new hosts, increased failure volume) 

Maintain service-account classification to reduce alert noise 

 
 

If you want, I can also: 

Shorten this to a one-paragraph “quick close” 

Rewrite it in Splunk ES / RBAC language 

Add a standard justification tag your team uses 

Create a closure macro you can reuse 

Just tell me how your SOC prefers closures formatted. 

one paragraph 

Benign Positive: Investigation determined the activity was generated by known non-interactive service accounts (oracle, sn_disscan, ivv_ansible) on RHEL systems. A 30-day review showed the failed password-change attempts were consistent, low-volume, and limited to expected hosts and binaries (passwd, chpasswd, usermod), occurring at predictable intervals indicative of automation. No evidence of interactive use, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or anomalous host expansion was observed. Activity aligns with normal service account behavior; no action required.
