CIRT Brief Report – Possible Malicious Activity

Metadata
- Date/Time: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]
- Analyst: [Name]
- Alert ID / Ticket: [alert id]
- Detection Source: [Splunk / Sentinel / Google Cloud / EDR]
- Alert Name / Rule: [rule name]
- Hostname / User: [hostname or username]
- Observed Severity (triage): [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

1) Executive Summary
- One-line summary: [what happened, primary indicator, suspected impact]

2) Detection Details
- Alert triggered: [when] — [short description of the event]
- Process(es): [process name(s) and PID(s)]
- Command line / Arguments: [full command lines observed]
- Parent process: [parent process + command line]
- Network indicators: [IPs, domains, ports]
- File indicators: [filenames, paths, hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256)]
- Sources queried: [Splunk/SIEM query, EDR logs, firewall logs]

3) Timeline (ordered)
- [T+0] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — Alert generated: [brief note]
- [T+1] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — Related process spawned: [details]
- [T+2] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — Outbound connection to: [IP/domain]

4) Evidence & Enrichment
- Logs pulled: [list of log sources and time ranges]
- Screenshots: [attached filenames or reference]
- Reputation lookups: VirusTotal / Recorded Future / PassiveDNS
	- IP: [ip] — [reputation summary]
	- Domain: [domain] — [reputation summary]
	- Hash: [hash] — [reputation summary]
- Additional artifacts: [PCAPs, process memory, EDR snapshots]

5) Analysis
- Observations: [concise bullet points of what the data shows]
- Why suspicious / why benign: [evidence-backed reasoning]
- Matches to TTPs: [e.g., PowerShell EncodedCommand, Living off the Land, Lateral Movement]
- Scope: [single host / user / multiple hosts]

6) Impact Assessment
- Potential impact: [credential theft, persistence, lateral movement, data exfil]
- Likely severity if confirmed: [Low/Medium/High]

7) Hypothesis
- [Short hypothesis summarizing intent and likely next steps of the actor or explanation if benign]

8) Recommended Immediate Actions (Triage)
- [ ] Isolate host from network (if high confidence)
- [ ] Create forensic image / preserve volatile memory
- [ ] Block outbound IP(s) and domain(s) at firewall/Proxy
- [ ] Quarantine or remove identified files via EDR
- [ ] Reset impacted credentials / escalate password resets where needed
- [ ] Increase logging for related hosts/users (enable process command-line logging)

9) Recommended Follow-up Actions
- Perform focused hunt for same indicators across environment
- Review authentication logs for suspicious logon patterns
- Run AV/EDR full scan on affected hosts
- Reconstruct attacker timeline and map lateral movement
- Post-incident: patch, harden, and add detections if gap found

10) Communications / Stakeholders
- Notify: [CIRT, IT Ops, Legal, Affected Business Unit]
- External reporting required? [Yes/No]

11) Attachments & References
- Attached evidence: [list of files, screenshots, queries]
- Relevant queries used: [include exact SIEM/EDR queries]

12) Notes / Next Steps
- [Analyst notes—e.g., need additional logs, host access, or confirmation from asset owner]

Please review and advise whether this activity is expected for the host/user, or whether CIRT should escalate and perform containment/remediation.
