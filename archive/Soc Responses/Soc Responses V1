🔹 Non-Malicious Response Snippets — Enhanced

Purpose: Fast, copy-ready responses for common, non-malicious detections. Fill placeholders and attach supporting logs/screenshots when closing or documenting.

1) Inbound Activity — False Positive
Case Summary: Inbound activity from [SOURCE_IP/DOMAIN] to [HOSTNAME] at [TIMEFRAME] determined non-malicious after review.
Key Findings:
- Source reputation: [scanner/service/provider].
- No exploitation or follow-on suspicious activity observed.
- Correlated logs (firewall/Proxy/EDR) show expected behavior; no persistence/exfiltration identified.
Conclusion: False positive — document and monitor.
Recommendation: Record in change log; no escalation unless recurrence with anomalous behavior.

2) Scheduled Task — Expected/Maintenance
Case Summary: Scheduled task on [HOSTNAME] for [USERNAME] at [TIMEFRAME].
Key Findings:
- Task matches documented maintenance (updates/backup).
- Binary/signature verified and path trusted: [path].
Conclusion: Expected/benign.
Recommendation: Document; no remediation required.

3) Failed Login Attempts — User Error
Case Summary: Multiple failed logins for [USERNAME] on [HOSTNAME] between [START_TIME] and [END_TIME].
Key Findings:
- Origin: [internal_ip] (known user device).
- Subsequent successful login; no signs of brute force or lateral movement.
Conclusion: User error.
Recommendation: Advise user to confirm credentials and MFA; monitor for repeats.

4) URI / Domain Detection — Benign
Case Summary: URI request to [URI/DOMAIN] flagged on [HOSTNAME] at [TIMEFRAME].
Key Findings:
- TI indicates benign domain tied to [service/app].
- No payloads or suspicious follow-up activity.
Conclusion: False positive.
Recommendation: Close as informational; attach logs for audit.

Standard Response (copy/paste):
"Summary: At [TIMEFRAME], an alert for [ALERT_NAME] on [HOSTNAME] was investigated. The activity was determined to be [CATEGORY] — [brief reason]. Evidence: [key evidence]. Recommended action: [recommended action]. Please advise if you want escalation to CIRT."

Usage Tips:
- Always attach the SIEM query and time range used for the review.
- When marking false positive, include at least one supporting log screenshot or excerpt.
- Keep a small 'favorites' list of snippets you use frequently for speed.
