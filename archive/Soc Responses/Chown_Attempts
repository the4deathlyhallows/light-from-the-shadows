After reviewing the context of the chown events on ndcwbarciss01, we determined that the activity aligns with expected behavior for this host. The account in question is likely tied to a system-level process or automation framework that periodically adjusts file ownership as part of its operational workflow. No indicators of compromise or privilege escalation were observed, and the scope of the changes was limited to known directories. Closing as false positive.
