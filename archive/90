Subject: Request for IP Block — “90 CIRT IP Block” Alert
Body:
During routine monitoring, an alert titled “90 CIRT IP Block” was triggered, indicating potential malicious network activity originating from the following IP address(es): [insert IPs, comma-delimited]. These IPs were identified as malicious by Recorded Future and further corroborated through VirusTotal, which returned elevated reputation and threat scores.
The activity was observed on [insert date and time], targeting [insert device hostname(s) or IPs] within our environment. Associated requests included [insert URI strings], returning HTTP status codes [insert status codes]. The nature and timing of these requests suggest a high likelihood of external probing, scanning, or exploitation attempts.
We are requesting that CIRT review and verify whether these IPs are part of any whitelisted assets, penetration testing ranges, or approved threat emulation activities. If these IPs are not associated with authorized operations, we recommend initiating a block across perimeter defenses and updating our threat intelligence watchlists accordingly.
Please confirm whether these IPs should be blocked or retained, and advise on any additional actions needed for log retention or correlation.
