OWASP Top 10 – Key Points for Interviews
#	Category	Description	Example / Detection Tips
A01	Broken Access Control	Users can perform actions or access resources they shouldn’t	Detect with log review of privilege escalations; check URL patterns, API calls
A02	Cryptographic Failures	Sensitive data not protected properly (weak encryption, cleartext storage)	Monitor unencrypted traffic, weak TLS ciphers, insecure key storage
A03	Injection	SQL, LDAP, OS, XML injections	Detect unusual query patterns, error messages, or log anomalies
A04	Insecure Design	Security not considered during architecture	Evaluate threat modeling, review design docs
A05	Security Misconfiguration	Default configs, verbose errors, exposed management interfaces	Check config baselines, scan for open ports, missing patches
A06	Vulnerable & Outdated Components	Using libraries/frameworks with known CVEs	Monitor dependency updates, vulnerability scanners, patch compliance
A07	Identification & Authentication Failures	Weak passwords, poor MFA, credential stuffing	Detect brute-force attempts, multiple failed logins, MFA bypass attempts
A08	Software & Data Integrity Failures	Unauthorized code changes, supply chain attacks	Verify code signatures, CI/CD pipeline monitoring, integrity checks
A09	Security Logging & Monitoring Failures	Missing or inadequate logging and alerting	Ensure event collection, retention, and SIEM monitoring
A10	Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)	Server is tricked to make requests to internal services	Monitor outbound requests from web servers, unusual internal traffic
