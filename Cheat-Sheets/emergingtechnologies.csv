"Front","Back"
"Cloud-native Apps / Microservices","Often deployed in containers. Likely exploits: misconfigured APIs, container escape, lateral movement inside clusters, vulnerable 3rd-party images."
"Serverless / Function-as-a-Service (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)","Likely exploits: excessive permissions (IAM), event injection, vulnerable dependencies, function chaining attacks."
"Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)","Likely exploits: exposed API server, RBAC misconfigurations, etcd access, container escape, pod-to-pod lateral movement."
"DevOps / CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)","Likely exploits: compromised build agents, malicious pipeline scripts, token theft, insecure artifact storage."
"Zero Trust / Identity-based Networking","Likely attacks: token theft, misconfigured policies, lateral movement via excessive privileges, identity-based attacks (SSO/OAuth abuse)."
"IoT Devices / Edge Computing","Likely exploits: weak/default credentials, outdated firmware, unencrypted comms, lateral pivot to corporate network, botnet recruitment."
"AI / ML Systems","Likely attacks: model poisoning, data poisoning, adversarial inputs, inference attacks, exfiltration of sensitive training data."
"Blockchain / Smart Contracts","Likely exploits: code vulnerabilities (reentrancy, integer overflow), misconfigured private keys, insecure nodes or APIs."
"5G / Mobile Edge","Likely exploits: network slicing misconfigurations, exposed APIs, insecure edge computing nodes, protocol-level attacks."
"Quantum Computing (future impact)","Security impact: could break current public-key crypto (RSA/ECC). Emergent focus on post-quantum cryptography and key management."
"Hybrid Cloud / Multi-Cloud Environments","Likely exploits: misconfigured cross-cloud IAM roles, unencrypted data transfer, inconsistent monitoring, lateral movement between clouds."
"Containers with Serverless Functions (Knative, OpenFaaS)","Likely exploits: combination of container escape and function misconfiguration; weak access controls; unpatched runtime images."
"Digital Twins / Industrial IoT","Likely exploits: SCADA/ICS vulnerabilities, exposed APIs, lateral movement to critical control networks, unpatched software."
"Edge AI / On-device ML","Likely exploits: model inversion attacks, adversarial inputs, exfiltration from local device memory or sensors."
"Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)","Likely attacks: misconfigured policy enforcement, token compromise, interception of tunneled traffic, cloud misconfigurations."
