"Front","Back"
"PsExec","Remote execution tool. Runs processes on remote systems with full interactivity. (Often abused for lateral movement.)"
"Procmon (Process Monitor)","Advanced monitoring of file system, registry, and process/thread activity in real-time."

"Autoruns","Enumerates all persistence mechanisms (startup programs, services, drivers, scheduled tasks, etc.)."
"TCPView","Real-time list of network connections (TCP/UDP endpoints), great for spotting C2 traffic."
"Sysmon","Event logging tool (writes to Windows Event Log). Captures process creation, network connections, registry changes, etc."
"PsList","Shows detailed process information, including memory, threads, CPU usage."
"PsKill","Terminates processes locally or remotely."
"PsInfo","Displays detailed system information (OS version, uptime, hotfixes)."

"VMMap","Shows virtual memory allocations by process."
"SDelete","Secure delete tool (overwrites file content to prevent recovery)."
"DU (Disk Usage)","Reports directory size and disk usage recursively."

üîç What is Sysinternals?
Sysinternals is a collection of advanced Windows utilities originally developed by Mark Russinovich (co-founder of Winternals Software, later acquired by Microsoft).
Today it‚Äôs officially published under Microsoft Sysinternals, and the tools are free to download from Microsoft.
üõ†Ô∏è What are they used for?
They give administrators, security analysts, and power users deep insight and control over Windows internals that normal tools (like Task Manager or built-in commands) don‚Äôt provide.
Common use cases:
System troubleshooting (performance, hangs, startup issues)
Security investigations (malware detection, persistence, lateral movement)
Forensics & monitoring (processes, registry, file system, memory, network)
IT administration (remote execution, system inventory, service management)
üß© Categories of Sysinternals Tools
Process & System Monitoring
Process Explorer (ProcExp) ‚Üí Advanced Task Manager.
Process Monitor (ProcMon) ‚Üí File, registry, and process activity trace.
Sysmon ‚Üí System Monitor that logs events to Event Log (widely used in DFIR).
Startup & Autoruns
Autoruns ‚Üí Lists all programs and drivers that start automatically.
Networking
TCPView ‚Üí Real-time network connection viewer.
PsTools (PsExec, PsKill, PsLoggedOn, etc.) ‚Üí Remote management.
Security & Forensics
Sigcheck ‚Üí Verify digital signatures, VirusTotal integration.
AccessChk ‚Üí Show effective file/registry/service permissions.
Strings ‚Üí Extract readable text from binaries.
Disk & Memory Tools
RAMMap ‚Üí Memory usage breakdown.
Disk2VHD ‚Üí Convert physical disk to virtual disk.
SDelete ‚Üí Secure file deletion.
üéØ Why it matters for cybersecurity
Attackers use them: PsExec, PsKill, and others are abused for lateral movement or stealthy operations.
Defenders rely on them: ProcMon, Autoruns, Sysmon, and Sigcheck are go-to tools for detection and incident response.
DFIR staple: Sysinternals is in almost every forensic toolkit because it‚Äôs lightweight, portable, and Microsoft-supported.
‚ö° TL;DR: Sysinternals = Microsoft‚Äôs Swiss Army knife for Windows internals.
They let you see and control everything happening under the hood ‚Äî from processes to registry, from network connections to system memory.
