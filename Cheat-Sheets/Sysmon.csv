"Front","Back"
"What is Sysmon?","Sysinternals System Monitor. A Windows service/driver that logs detailed system activity (process, network, registry, etc.) into Event Logs."
"Where does Sysmon log events?","Into the Windows Event Log under Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon/Operational."
"Sysmon Event ID 1","Process Creation — logs new processes with parent, command line, hashes."
"Sysmon Event ID 3","Network Connection — logs TCP/UDP connections with source/dest IP, port, process."
"Sysmon Event ID 7","Image Loaded — logs DLL or driver loaded by a process."
"Sysmon Event ID 8","CreateRemoteThread — often used in process injection attacks."
"Sysmon Event ID 10","Process Access — logs access to another process’s memory (Mimikatz, LSASS dumping)."
"Sysmon Event ID 11","File Create — logs file creation with full path and process info."
"Sysmon Event ID 13","Registry Value Set — logs changes to registry values (persistence, tampering)."
"Sysmon Event ID 22","DNS Query — logs DNS lookups with process context."
"Sysmon Event ID 23","File Delete (Archived) — logs and can capture deleted files."
"Sysmon Event ID 255","Sysmon Configuration Change — logs whenever Sysmon config is updated."
"What is the Sysmon config file?","XML file that defines what events Sysmon collects and filters."
"Who develops Sysmon?","Mark Russinovich and Microsoft Sysinternals team."
"Why is Sysmon valuable for defenders?","Provides high-fidelity telemetry for detecting ATT&CK techniques (execution, persistence, credential access, etc.)."
"Example ATT&CK technique detected with Event ID 1","T1059 Command Execution (PowerShell, cmd, Python)."
"Example ATT&CK technique detected with Event ID 10","T1003 Credential Dumping (LSASS memory access)."
"Example ATT&CK technique detected with Event ID 3","T1071 Application Layer Protocol (C2 via HTTP/DNS)."
"Example ATT&CK technique detected with Event ID 13","Persistence via registry run keys (T1547)."
"Sysmon default config?","By default, Sysmon is minimal; defenders use community configs like SwiftOnSecurity or Olaf Hartong’s Sysmon Modular."
"How to install Sysmon?","Run `sysmon.exe -accepteula -i config.xml`."
"How to update Sysmon config?","Run `sysmon.exe -c config.xml`."
"How to uninstall Sysmon?","Run `sysmon.exe -u`."
"Common challenge with Sysmon?","Generates lots of data → requires tuned config to reduce noise."
"How does Sysmon help incident response?","Correlates processes, network, registry, and file events to trace attacker behavior."
