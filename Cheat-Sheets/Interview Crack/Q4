🔄 Scenario Question
"You notice multiple failed Kerberos logons (EventID 4771) followed by a successful TGS request (4769) for a high-value service account. What hypotheses would you form, and what next steps would you take to investigate?"
This tests your ability to form hypotheses, not just repeat detection steps.

🛠 Tool Choice Question
"You suspect lateral movement via WMI and WinRM in your environment. Which tools would you use to investigate this, and why would you choose them over others?"
This tests practical tool knowledge (Sysmon, EDR, PowerShell logging, Sysinternals, Splunk queries, etc.).

⚖️ Trade-Off Question
"If you could only monitor three Windows Event IDs for credential theft and lateral movement detection, which would you choose and why?"
This forces you to prioritize and justify. (Good picks: 4688 – process creation, 4769 – Kerberoast TGS requests, 4624 – logons).

🧩 Puzzle Question (Attack Chain)
"An attacker compromised a workstation. They used Kerberoasting to grab service account creds, cracked them offline, then moved laterally with WMI, and finally set a scheduled task for persistence. Map these steps to MITRE ATT&CK and explain where you’d hunt for evidence."
This checks whether you can link multiple TTPs into a story, which is huge in interviews.

Perfect choice 👌 — the trade-off question is a classic senior-hunter style prompt.
⚖️ Interview Question
"If you could only monitor three Windows Event IDs for credential theft and lateral movement detection, which would you choose and why?"
✅ Strong Answer
1. EventID 4688 – Process Creation
Why: Almost every credential dumping or lateral movement tool spawns a process. Mimikatz, procdump, PsExec, WMIC, PowerShell — all show up here.
Benefit: Gives visibility into attacker tools and living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).
Caveat: High volume — needs filtering (e.g., baseline common processes).
2. EventID 4769 – Kerberos Service Ticket Request (TGS)
Why: This is the pivot point for Kerberoasting. Attackers request service tickets to crack offline.
Benefit: Detects early credential theft attempts targeting service accounts.
Caveat: Requires tuning — admins also request tickets, but high volume or RC4-only tickets are suspicious.
3. EventID 4624 – Logon
Why: Core to spotting lateral movement. Different logon types reveal behavior:
Type 3 = Network (SMB/Pass-the-Hash).
Type 10 = Remote interactive (RDP).
Benefit: Lets you correlate account usage across hosts (e.g., one account logging into 10 servers in 5 minutes).
Caveat: Noisy — but critical when correlated with host and account baselines.
🔑 Framing the Trade-off
“I’d pick 4688, 4769, and 4624 because they cover three critical detection layers: attacker tooling, credential theft, and lateral movement. While other events (4656 LSASS access, 4104 PowerShell script logging) add depth, those three give me the broadest detection coverage if I’m resource-constrained. I’d then layer baselining and correlation in Splunk to reduce noise and surface real threats.”
👉 That answer shows you understand both detection value and operational trade-offs.
Want me to now throw you a mock trade-off question (like: “pick 2 Sysmon events for the same goal”), and you try to answer it — then I’ll refine your response?
