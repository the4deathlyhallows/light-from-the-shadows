Sysmon Trade-Off Interview Questions & Model Answers
#	Question	Model Answer Summary
1	You can only enable 2 Sysmon Event IDs to detect lateral movement and credential theft. Which ones and why?	EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ detect tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, PowerShell scripts.
EventID 3 (Network Connection) â†’ detect unusual SMB, WMI, WinRM connections. Noise mitigated via whitelisting and baselining.
2	You need to monitor persistence techniques with minimal Sysmon logging. Which 2 events do you enable?	EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ scheduled tasks, startup binaries.
EventID 7 (Registry Create/Modify) â†’ autoruns, Run/RunOnce keys. Noise reduced via excluding standard IT admin modifications.
3	Youâ€™re concerned about file-based malware dropping tools. Which Sysmon Event IDs would you choose?	EventID 11 (FileCreate) â†’ new files in sensitive directories.
EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ execution of dropped files. Noise mitigated by ignoring normal temp or software updates directories.
4	You want to detect credential theft but must minimize log volume. Which events?	EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ LSASS dumps.
EventID 10 (ProcessAccess) â†’ access to LSASS or other sensitive processes. Only log access from non-whitelisted accounts to reduce noise.
5	If you can monitor only 1 Sysmon event to detect suspicious PowerShell activity, which would you choose?	EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ captures PowerShell execution and scripts.
Optionally correlate with EventID 8 (CreateRemoteThread) if lateral movement is suspected. Use hashes and command-line filters to reduce noise.
6	Youâ€™re asked to prioritize detection for lateral movement via SMB. Which 2 events?	EventID 3 (Network Connection) â†’ SMB connections to unusual hosts.
EventID 1 (Process Creation) â†’ PsExec, WMI, or other tools initiating connections. Baseline standard network and admin tools.
ðŸ”‘ Tips for Answering These in Interviews
Always explain reasoning: Donâ€™t just name IDs â€” explain why each detects a TTP.
Mention noise mitigation: Shows operational maturity.
Tie to ATT&CK: Optional, but mapping to TTPs impresses senior interviewers.
