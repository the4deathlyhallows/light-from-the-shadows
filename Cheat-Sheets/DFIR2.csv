"Front","Back"
"Amcache.hve","Registry artifact that logs executed programs and installer metadata. Useful for identifying application execution history."
"USN Journal","NTFS file that tracks changes to the file system including creates, deletes, and modifications."
"Shellbags","Registry artifact that records folder view settings. Can indicate user navigation and deleted directories."
"Event Log Artifacts in Memory","Event logs can be partially recovered from memory when cleared from disk."
"Jump Lists","Windows artifact that stores recently accessed files and applications, useful for user activity reconstruction."
"LNK Files","Shortcut files that reveal target paths, access times, and can indicate removable media usage."
"Pagefile.sys Analysis","Pagefile contains memory artifacts, including remnants of terminated processes and injected code."
"Prefetch vs Shimcache","Prefetch tracks application execution timing; Shimcache persists even if the file is deleted."
"USN vs $MFT","$MFT contains static file metadata; USN Journal tracks changes over time for incremental activity."
"Volatility cmdscan","Analyzes command history in memory (cmd.exe, PowerShell) to detect suspicious commands."
"Volatility consoles","Retrieves console history for shell processes to identify user/malware commands."
"Volatility ldrmodules","Detects loaded DLLs in processes; useful for identifying injected or malicious DLLs."
"Volatility getsids","Extracts process security identifiers (SIDs) to map user context and potential privilege escalation."
"Windows Event ID 4624","Successful logon events; important for user activity and lateral movement tracking."
"Windows Event ID 4625","Failed logon attempts; can indicate brute force attacks."
"Windows Event ID 4672","Special privileges assigned to new logons; often targeted by attackers for privilege escalation."
"Windows Event ID 4698","Scheduled task creation; can indicate persistence mechanisms."
"Windows Event ID 7045","Service installation; can indicate malicious service persistence."
"Prefetch Artifacts Location","C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\ contains .pf files that track executable usage."
"Registry NTUSER.DAT Hives","Contains user-specific artifacts including MRU lists, Run keys, and application settings."
"File Slack Analysis","Residual data in cluster slack can contain deleted file remnants."
"Pagefile vs Hiberfil.sys","Pagefile.sys contains memory artifacts; hiberfil.sys contains complete system memory state for live analysis."
"Alternate Data Streams (ADS)","Hidden data attached to NTFS files; commonly abused for malware or exfiltration."
"UserAssist Keys","Registry artifact tracking user activity via GUI; useful for timeline reconstruction."
"Network Artifact: ARP Cache","Lists recent MAC-IP mappings; can indicate internal network connections."
"Network Artifact: DNS Cache","Stores recent DNS queries; useful for identifying external C2 or exfil destinations."
"Registry Artifact: MRU Lists","Most Recently Used lists that record files, directories, and applications accessed by users."
"Shadow Copies","Volume snapshots that can be used to recover deleted files or prior system states."
"Timeline Correlation","Combine $MFT, USN, Prefetch, Event Logs, Registry artifacts to reconstruct events chronologically."
"Sysmon Event ID 11","File Create — can be used to detect suspicious file creation or ransomware activity."
"Sysmon Event ID 12","Registry object create/delete events; useful for monitoring persistence and malware artifacts."
"Sysmon Event ID 15","File stream creation; can detect Alternate Data Stream abuse."
"Malware Anti-Forensics Detection","Identify timestomping, log clearing, memory-only malware, and obfuscated binaries."
"Memory Resident Malware Indicators","Suspicious process injection, unmapped PE files, stealthy handles, network connections without disk artifacts."
"Credential Theft Indicators","LSASS memory access, Mimikatz execution, cached domain credentials, Pass-the-Hash detection."
"Suspicious Network Patterns","Beaconing, repeated connections to external IPs, unusual ports, encrypted traffic without business justification."
"Lateral Movement Detection","Remote process execution (PsExec, WMI, RDP), abnormal SMB activity, unusual logon events."
"Timeline Gaps","Periods where logs are missing or cleared; often indicate attacker activity or anti-forensics measures."
"Command-Line Auditing","Monitoring process command-line arguments to detect obfuscated commands or malware execution."
"Dynamic Analysis vs Static Analysis","Dynamic: analyze malware during execution; Static: analyze files without executing them."
"File Entropy Analysis","High entropy can indicate encrypted or compressed malicious files."
"Disk Carving Tools","Recover deleted files from unallocated space: Scalpel, Foremost, X-Ways."
"Registry Forensic Tools","RegRipper, Registry Explorer — extract and analyze Windows registry artifacts."
