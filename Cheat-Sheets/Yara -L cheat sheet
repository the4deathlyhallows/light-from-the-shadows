I need to learn Yara -l for my job as a detection engineering to be able to build rules in Google secops. Ive used splunk and kusto query language but i am having difficulty learning this language 
ChatGPT said:
That’s a great focus — and it makes total sense you’d find YARA-L (the YARA-like language in Google SecOps) confusing at first. It’s quite different from Splunk SPL or KQL because it’s rule-based, pattern-oriented, and not a traditional query language.
Let’s make this easier by breaking it into four practical layers that align with how a detection engineer actually uses YARA-L in Google SecOps (Chronicle):

🧩 1. What YARA-L Is (and Isn’t)
YARA-L = a detection rule language, not a query language.
You’re not asking “show me all events where...”
You’re defining a condition that should trigger a detection when matching data appears.
Used for:
Writing detections in Google SecOps (Chronicle).
Matching on parsed fields or raw logs.
Combining logic with filters and time windows.
🧱 2. The Rule Structure (Anatomy of YARA-L)
Every YARA-L rule follows this structure:
rule Example_Rule_Name {
  meta:
    author = "Robert Clark"
    description = "Detects suspicious login behavior"
    severity = "medium"

  events:
    $eventA.metadata.event_type = "LOGIN"
    $eventB.metadata.event_type = "FILE_DOWNLOAD"

  condition:
    $eventA.principal.email = $eventB.principal.email
    and $eventA.target.ip != $eventB.target.ip
    within 10m
}
Breakdown:
meta: — documentation about the rule.
events: — define one or more event types or log sources to look at.
condition: — the logic combining those events.
within — defines a time window.
🔍 3. Filtering and Matching (The Part That Trips Most People Up)
In YARA-L, you use filters on parsed fields or raw logs.
Example: Filtering by Field
$event.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
and $event.principal.user = "SYSTEM"
You can also use wildcards and operators:
Operator	Description	Example
=~	Regex match	$event.target.file.name =~ ".*powershell.*"
IN	List match	$event.metadata.vendor IN ["Windows", "Linux"]
!=	Not equal	$event.target.process.name != "cmd.exe"
EXISTS	Field exists	$event.target.process.command_line EXISTS
🧠 4. Thinking Like a Detection Engineer in YARA-L
You’re not pulling data for analysis — you’re describing patterns over time.
That means your mental model shifts:
In Splunk/KQL	In YARA-L
index=logs process_name=powershell	$event.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
stats count by user	Count patterns or sequences within a rule
where count > 5	Use YARA-L’s aggregation/sequence logic (e.g. count($event) > 5 within 5m)
join	Multiple $eventA, $eventB definitions with shared field logic
⚙️ 5. Examples for Practice
Example 1: Suspicious PowerShell Execution
rule Suspicious_PowerShell {
  meta:
    description = "Detect PowerShell executions by non-admin users"

  events:
    $event.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"

  condition:
    $event.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
    and $event.principal.user != "Administrator"
}
Example 2: Multiple Failed Logins
rule Brute_Force_Attempt {
  meta:
    description = "Detect multiple failed logins within 5 minutes"

  events:
    $event.metadata.event_type = "LOGIN"
    and $event.metadata.outcome = "FAILURE"

  condition:
    count($event) > 5 within 5m
}
🚀 6. Next Steps to Build Proficiency
Here’s a short learning roadmap for YARA-L:
Stage	Goal	Practice
1. Syntax	Learn event structure, condition logic	Recreate simple Splunk detections in YARA-L
2. Field Referencing	Work with metadata., principal., target. fields	Use Chronicle’s field reference guide
3. Multi-event rules	Combine two events ($eventA, $eventB)	Write rules detecting sequence of actions
4. Optimization	Add filters to reduce false positives	Use metadata.vendor, metadata.product filters
5. Validation	Test in Chronicle’s Rule Simulator	Review matched logs to fine-tune conditions
If you’d like, I can build a hands-on YARA-L lab series for you — each one mirroring something you’d write as a detection engineer (e.g., process abuse, lateral movement, credential access).
Would you like me to start you with Lesson 1: translating a Splunk/KQL detection into YARA-L to make it feel more intuitive?
You said:
i am getting confused on the log_source log_type and why you put event.principal and metadata.type etc
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question — and this is exactly where most people get stuck when moving from Splunk/KQL to Google SecOps (YARA-L).
Let’s slow it down and make this very clear and visual, because understanding why you use log_source, log_type, metadata, principal, target, etc. is the key to mastering YARA-L.

🧩 1. The Big Picture: What’s Inside a Chronicle Event
Every log that comes into Google SecOps (Chronicle) is parsed into a standardized schema called the Unified Data Model (UDM).
Think of it like this:

Raw Log → Parsed (UDM Fields) → Used in YARA-L Rules
That means all your different sources — Windows, Linux, Okta, CrowdStrike — get mapped to a common field layout, so you can write one rule that works across many vendors.
📦 2. The UDM Hierarchy (Simplified Mental Model)
Every event object in YARA-L has “top-level” field families.
You’ll see these used all the time:
Prefix	What It Describes	Example
metadata	Info about the log itself	metadata.event_type, metadata.vendor, metadata.product, metadata.event_timestamp
principal	The actor who did something (user, process, device)	principal.user, principal.hostname, principal.ip
target	The thing being acted upon	target.file.name, target.process.name, target.hostname
about	Optional — extra context entity	about.file.name, about.ip
So when you see:
$event.principal.user = "SYSTEM"
It means: “the user that performed the action was SYSTEM.”
And when you see:

$event.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
It means: “the process being launched or targeted was PowerShell.”
🧠 3. Why metadata and principal Are Everywhere
Because YARA-L rules aren’t written for one single product like Splunk’s index=win*; they’re meant to detect behaviors regardless of source.
For example:

What You Want to Detect	Field Family You Use	Example
Filter by log type	metadata.event_type	"PROCESS_LAUNCH", "LOGIN", "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
Filter by vendor/source	metadata.vendor, metadata.product	"Microsoft", "Windows", "CrowdStrike"
Filter by actor	principal.*	principal.user, principal.hostname
Filter by target	target.*	target.process.name, target.file.path
🗂️ 4. About log_source and log_type
You’ll sometimes see rules like this:
$event.metadata.log_source = "VMware ESXi"
and $event.metadata.log_type = "AUTHENTICATION"
Chronicle’s schema allows these optional metadata tags to filter your rule by:
log_source — where the data originated (e.g., "Okta", "Windows", "CrowdStrike").
log_type — the type of event (e.g., "PROCESS_LAUNCH", "NETWORK_CONNECTION", "AUTHENTICATION").
👉 These are basically filters to narrow what logs the rule even considers, before applying your condition.
🧱 5. How It Fits Together
Here’s a full simple rule explained:
rule Detect_PowerShell_Exec {
  meta:
    description = "Detect PowerShell executions on Windows endpoints"

  events:
    $event.metadata.vendor = "Microsoft"
    $event.metadata.product = "Windows"
    $event.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $event.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"

  condition:
    $event
}
Line-by-line:
metadata.vendor / metadata.product → limit scope to Windows logs.
metadata.event_type → only process launch logs.
target.process.name → the process being launched (target).
principal (if you add it) → who launched the process.
⚙️ 6. Splunk/KQL to YARA-L Mapping Example
In Splunk	In Chronicle (YARA-L)
sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security	metadata.vendor="Microsoft" and metadata.product="Windows"
EventCode=4688	metadata.event_type="PROCESS_LAUNCH"
Image="C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"	target.process.name="powershell.exe"
User!="Administrator"	principal.user != "Administrator"
🧭 7. Mental Shortcut
Whenever you’re confused which field prefix to use:
Ask: Who did the action? → principal
Ask: What was done to what? → target
Ask: What kind of event is this? → metadata.event_type
Ask: Where did this log come from? → metadata.vendor, metadata.product, metadata.log_source
Would you like me to make you a YARA-L Field Cheat Sheet for Google SecOps, showing all the most common metadata, principal, and target fields you’ll actually use when building detections (with examples for Windows, Okta, and GCP)?

🧠 Quick Mental Model Recap
Question	Prefix	Example
Who did it?	principal	principal.user = "bob"
What was acted on?	target	target.file.name = "malware.exe"
What type of event is it?	metadata.event_type	"PROCESS_LAUNCH"
Where did it come from?	metadata.vendor, metadata.product	"Microsoft", "Okta"
Is there secondary context?	about	about.file.name = "payload.dll"
Would you like me to make Lesson 1: translating your first Splunk rule into YARA-L next — using a real detection (like suspicious PowerShell, multiple failed logins, or Okta MFA fatigue)?
It’ll show you exactly how the fields above translate into a Chronicle detection.
You said:
i saw a video that said they created a variable $process.principal.user please explain the $process
ChatGPT said:
Excellent catch — and great question. 👏
That $process variable you saw is one of the trickiest parts of YARA-L to understand at first, because it looks like “magic.” Let’s break it down clearly so you’ll never be confused about $process, $event, $login, etc. again.
🧩 1. What $process Actually Is
In YARA-L, the dollar-sign variables (like $event, $process, $login, $dns) are just labels that you give to specific event filters inside your rule’s events: section.
They aren’t special keywords — you can name them whatever helps describe what that event is doing.

So when you see:

$process.principal.user = "SYSTEM"
It means:
“Look at the event (which I’m calling $process) and filter where the principal user is SYSTEM.”
Here $process is simply a nickname you’ve given for an event pattern that involves process activity.
🧱 2. Why People Use $process, $login, $file, etc.
Because you can have multiple event types in the same rule — each representing a different action or stage of an attack.
For example:
events:
  $login.metadata.event_type = "LOGIN"
  $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
Now in your condition: section, you can relate them:
condition:
  $login.principal.user = $process.principal.user
  and $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
  within 10m
✅ Translation:
“If a user logs in and then within 10 minutes launches PowerShell, trigger the rule.”
That’s why $process.principal.user works — it’s just the principal.user field of the event variable you named $process.
🧠 3. Naming Convention Tip
You can name the variable anything:
$eventA.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
$eventB.metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
Or more descriptive:
$process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
$network.metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
Both are valid!
The descriptive version simply makes your rule easier to read.
🧩 4. How $process Relates to principal and target
Here’s what’s happening logically:
Part	Meaning
$process	the variable you defined for a process event
principal.user	the user who launched the process
target.process.name	the process that was launched
So:
$process.principal.user
= “The user who launched the process”
and

$process.target.process.name
= “The process name that was launched”
🧮 5. Full Example: Correlating Login → Process Launch
rule Login_then_PowerShell {
  meta:
    description = "Detect PowerShell launched soon after login"

  events:
    $login.metadata.event_type = "LOGIN"
    $login.metadata.vendor = "Microsoft"
    $login.metadata.product = "Windows"

    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $process.metadata.vendor = "Microsoft"
    $process.metadata.product = "Windows"
    $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"

  condition:
    $login.principal.user = $process.principal.user
    within 10m
}
Explanation:
$login = the login event
$process = the process-launch event
The condition says: if the same user logged in and then launched PowerShell within 10 minutes → detection!
🔍 6. Summary Cheat Sheet
You See	Means
$event	Generic event variable (default)
$process	Event variable representing process activity
$login	Event variable representing login activity
$network	Event variable for network connection
$file	Event variable for file operations
$process.principal.user	User who launched the process
$process.target.process.name	Process name launched
$login.principal.user	User who logged in
If you want, I can show you how to build a two-event rule from scratch (like “network connection to a suspicious IP right after PowerShell starts”), so you can see how $process and $network work together visually.
Would you like me to walk you through that next?

You said:
how do know the meta data field types , process names, or the possible inputs into quotations 
ChatGPT said:
🔥 Excellent question — this is the key to writing working detections in Chronicle (YARA-L) instead of guessing field names or values. Every strong detection engineer learns where these values come from and how to verify them before writing a rule.
Let’s go step-by-step so you can do this confidently on your own every time.

🧩 1. Where YARA-L Field Names and Values Come From
In Google SecOps (Chronicle), all logs are normalized into the Unified Data Model (UDM).
That means every event—Windows, Okta, CrowdStrike, etc.—is parsed into standard field names such as:
metadata.event_type
principal.user
target.process.name
Those fields (and their possible values) are defined by Google’s UDM schema, not by you.
You can look them up in the official Chronicle UDM Field Reference.
👉 Official doc:
https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/udm-field-list

That page lists:

All metadata.*, principal.*, target.* fields
Accepted data types (string, enum, timestamp, int)
Example values
Event type enumerations (e.g. PROCESS_LAUNCH, LOGIN, NETWORK_CONNECTION)
⚙️ 2. How to Discover Valid Field Values in Your Own Data
You don’t have to guess strings like "PROCESS_LAUNCH" or "Okta".
You can pull them directly from your Chronicle data using the Log Viewer or Rule Simulator.
🔍 In Chronicle Log Viewer:
Go to Search → Logs.
Filter by your product (e.g. Windows, Okta).
Expand a single event.
Look at the parsed fields panel — it shows exactly what’s available and their values.
Example output might show:
metadata.vendor: "Microsoft"
metadata.product: "Windows"
metadata.event_type: "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
principal.user: "bob"
target.process.name: "powershell.exe"
Now you know those exact field names and values will work in your YARA-L rule.
🧱 3. Enumerated (Predefined) Metadata Fields
Chronicle defines specific enumerations for certain metadata fields.
These are the values you’ll use inside quotes.
Common Examples:
Field	Possible Values	Notes
metadata.event_type	"PROCESS_LAUNCH", "NETWORK_CONNECTION", "LOGIN", "FILE_WRITE", "API_CALL"	UDM Event Types
metadata.vendor	"Microsoft", "Okta", "CrowdStrike", "Google"	Data source
metadata.product	"Windows", "Falcon", "Cloud Logging"	Product name
metadata.event_outcome	"SUCCESS", "FAILURE"	For auth events
metadata.log_source	"VMware ESXi", "Windows Security"	Optional custom field
🧠 Pro tip: these values are case-sensitive and must match the UDM normalization exactly.
So always copy them from your event preview.
👨‍💻 4. How to Discover Process Names and Field Inputs
For things like:
$process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
You discover these by looking at your actual logs.
Method 1 — Log Viewer:
Filter for metadata.event_type="PROCESS_LAUNCH" and expand results:
"target": {
  "process": {
    "name": "powershell.exe",
    "command_line": "powershell.exe -enc ..."
  }
}
Now you know "powershell.exe" is a valid string to match on.
Method 2 — Search or Detections in Chronicle:
Use the Event Viewer or Query Builder to see which process names exist most frequently:
metadata.event_type="PROCESS_LAUNCH"
Then pivot on the target.process.name field to see counts per process.
🧪 5. Testing a Field Before Using It in a Rule
Use the Rule Simulator (bottom-left in Chronicle).
Paste a snippet like this:
$test.metadata.vendor = "Microsoft"
$test.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
$test.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
condition: $test
Then hit Simulate to confirm matches.
If you get hits → your field names and values are correct.
If you get 0 → check for typos or different field names in your parsed data.
🧮 6. Quick Example From Real Logs → Rule
From Log Viewer:
metadata.vendor: "Microsoft"
metadata.product: "Windows"
metadata.event_type: "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
principal.user: "John"
target.process.name: "cmd.exe"
Becomes Rule:
rule Detect_CMD_Launch {
  meta:
    description = "Detect cmd.exe executions on Windows"

  events:
    $process.metadata.vendor = "Microsoft"
    $process.metadata.product = "Windows"
    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $process.target.process.name = "cmd.exe"

  condition:
    $process
}
🧭 7. Quick Checklist When Writing a New Rule
✅ Go to Chronicle → Search → Logs
✅ Find a relevant event (Windows, Okta, etc.)
✅ Expand the event → copy field names and values exactly
✅ Reference UDM field list to confirm data types
✅ Write YARA-L using those exact names
✅ Test in Rule Simulator
Would you like me to show you how to pull a field map for a specific source (e.g., “Windows Security Logs” or “Okta”) so you can see all fields and example values for that data type? That’s usually the next step for making this automatic.
You said:
please explain condition process condition:
    $process... is this similar to return in python
ChatGPT said:
✅ Fantastic question — and you nailed the comparison most people miss.
The condition: block in YARA-L is conceptually similar to a return statement in Python — it’s the final logic that decides whether the rule triggers (true) or does nothing (false).
Let’s unpack this carefully so you really understand what condition: does, why $process appears there, and how it works under the hood.

🧩 1. Rule Structure Reminder
Every YARA-L rule looks like this:
rule Rule_Name {
  meta:
    description = "What this rule detects"

  events:
    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"

  condition:
    $process
}
Chronicle reads your rule top to bottom:
meta: → just documentation (no logic).
events: → defines the data pattern(s) to look for (variables and filters).
condition: → evaluates if the rule should trigger (true/false).
🧠 2. So What Does condition: Really Do?
Think of it like the “return expression” of your rule.
In Python, you might write:

def suspicious_process(event):
    if event["process_name"] == "powershell.exe":
        return True
    return False
In YARA-L, that same logic looks like:
rule Suspicious_Process {
  events:
    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"

  condition:
    $process
}
🟢 Here condition: $process means:
“If any event matches the filters I defined for $process, trigger the rule (return true).”
So yes — you can think of it as:
return $process
⚙️ 3. When condition: Gets More Complex
You can use condition: to:
Combine multiple events ($process, $login, $network)
Use counts
Apply time windows
Add logical operators (and, or, not)
For example:
condition:
  $login.principal.user = $process.principal.user
  and $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
  within 10m
That means:
“Return true if both $login and $process matched, and they occurred within 10 minutes.”
🧩 4. You Can Think of Each $variable as a Filtered Dataset
When you write:
$process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
You’re saying:
“Give me all events where event_type = PROCESS_LAUNCH.”
Then, inside condition::
$process
means:
“If there is at least one $process event that matched → return true.”
💡 5. Examples Side-by-Side (YARA-L vs Python)
Concept	YARA-L	Python Equivalent
Define filter	$process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"	if event["event_type"] == "PROCESS_LAUNCH":
Add condition	condition: $process	return True
Combine events	$login.principal.user = $process.principal.user	if login["user"] == process["user"]:
Count check	count($login) > 5 within 10m	if len(logins_in_10m) > 5:
Logical AND/OR	and, or, not	same as Python
🧱 6. Real Example
rule Detect_PowerShell {
  meta:
    description = "Detects PowerShell executions by non-admin users"

  events:
    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"
    $process.principal.user != "Administrator"

  condition:
    $process
}
Chronicle logic (Python-style pseudocode):
if (
    event.event_type == "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    and event.process_name == "powershell.exe"
    and event.user != "Administrator"
):
    return True  # condition met → alert triggered
🧮 7. More Advanced Example
Detect PowerShell after login by same user within 10 minutes:
rule Login_then_PowerShell {
  meta:
    description = "Detect PowerShell execution shortly after login"

  events:
    $login.metadata.event_type = "LOGIN"
    $process.metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"
    $process.target.process.name = "powershell.exe"

  condition:
    $login.principal.user = $process.principal.user
    within 10m
}
Equivalent Python-like logic:
for login in login_events:
    for process in process_events:
        if login.user == process.user and (process.time - login.time) <= 10m:
            return True
🚀 8. Quick Recap
YARA-L Part	Purpose	Analogy
events:	Define variables + filters	“Collect the data you want to check”
condition:	Evaluate logic between events	“Return True if criteria met”
$process	Variable name for an event type	Like a dataset or object
$process in condition	“If at least one match”	Like return True
Would you like me to show you how to layer conditions (for example, only trigger if $process exists and $network connects to an external IP)?
That’s the next logical step — it’ll make “condition” second nature.
