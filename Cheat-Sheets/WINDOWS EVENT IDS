Event ID --> MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping 

Event ID	Description	Importance for Defenders	Example MITRE ATT&CK Technique
1102	Security Log cleared	May indicate an attacker is attempting to cover their tracks by clearing the security log (e.g., security log cleared after an unauthorized admin logon)	T1070 Indicator Removal on Host
4624	Successful account Logon	Helps identify unauthorized or suspicious logon attempts, and track user activity on the network (e.g., logons during off-hours from unusual hosts)	T1078 - Valid Accounts
4625	Failed account Logon	Indicates potential brute-force attacks or unauthorized attempts to access a system (e.g., multiple failed logons from a single source in a short time)	T1110 Brute Force
4648	Logon attempt with explicit credentials	May suggest credential theft or improper use of accounts (e.g., an attacker creates a new token for an account after compromising cleartext credentials)	T1134 - Access Token Manipulation
4662	An operation was performed on an object	Helps track access to critical objects in Active Directory, which could indicate unauthorized activity (e.g., an attacker performs a DCSync attack by performing replication from an unusual host)	T1530 - Data from Local System
4663	Access to an object was requested	Monitors attempts to perform specific actions on sensitive objects like files, processes, and registry keys, which could indicate unauthorized access (e.g., an attacker attempts to read a file or folder which has been specifically configured for auditing)	T1222 - File Permissions Modification
4670	Permissions on an object were changed	Helps detect potential tampering with sensitive files or unauthorized privilege escalation (e.g., a low-privileged user modifying permissions on a sensitive file to gain access)	T1078 - Valid Accounts
4672	Administrator privileges assigned to a new Logon	Helps detect privilege escalation and unauthorized admin account usage (e.g., a standard user suddenly granted admin rights without a change request)	T1078 - Valid Accounts
4698	A scheduled task was created	Helps detect malicious scheduled task creation and could indicate persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement (e.g., an attacker creates a scheduled task that runs a beacon periodically)	T1053 Scheduled Task/Job
4720	New user account created	Monitors for unauthorized account creation or potential insider threats (e.g., a new account created outside of normal business hours without HR approval)	T1136 Create Account
4724	An attempt was made to reset an account's password	Monitors for unauthorized password resets, which could indicate account takeover (e.g., an attacker resetting the password of a high-privileged account)	T1098 - Account Manipulation
4728	Member added to a security-enabled global group	Tracks changes to important security groups, which could indicate unauthorized privilege escalation (e.g., an attacker adds a user to the "Domain Admins" group)	T1098 - Account Manipulation
4732	Member added to a security-enabled Local group	Monitors changes to local security groups, which could suggest unauthorized access or privilege escalation (e.g., an attacker adds a user to the "Administrators" local group)	T1098 - Account Manipulation
4768	A Kerberos authentication ticket was requested (TGT Request)	Monitors initial authentication requests to track user logons, and helps identify potential abuse of the Kerberos protocol (e.g., an attacker compromises the NTLM hash of a privileged account and performs an overpass-the-hash attack which requests a TGT from an unusual host)	T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
4769	A Kerberos service ticket was requested	Monitors for potential Kerberoasting attacks or other suspicious activities targeting the Kerberos protocol (e.g., a sudden increase in requests for unique services from a single user)	T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
4776	The domain controller attempted to validate the credentials	Helps identify failed or successful attempts to validate credentials against the domain controller, which could indicate unauthorized access or suspicious authentication activity (e.g., an unusual number of failed validations from a single IP address)	T1110

Sure, as a Windows forensics analyzer, I can explain how to create event baselines with the COUNTIF function in Excel when investigating security-related events on Windows 10.

Creating event baselines can help you identify changes in the Windows event logs over time and detect potential security incidents. To create an event baseline with the COUNTIF function in Excel, follow these steps:

    Export the Windows event logs: First, you need to export the Windows event logs from the target machine. To do this, open the Event Viewer on the target machine, select the event logs you want to export, right-click, and select "Save All Events As." Choose the file type as "evt" or "evtx" and save the file to a location accessible from your computer.

    Import the Windows event logs into Excel: Launch Excel and go to the "Data" tab. Click on "From Text/CSV" and select the exported Windows event log file. Follow the prompts to import the Windows event logs into Excel.

    Filter the Windows event logs: Once the logs are imported, filter the logs for the specific event IDs or event sources that you want to create a baseline for. For example, you can filter the logs for event ID 4624, which indicates a successful login event.

    Use the COUNTIF function: After filtering the logs, you can use the COUNTIF function in Excel to count the number of occurrences of each event ID or event source. To use the COUNTIF function, select a cell where you want to display the count, then enter the formula "=COUNTIF(range, criteria)." In the "range" field, select the filtered event log column that contains the event IDs or event sources. In the "criteria" field, enter the specific event ID or event source that you want to count. For example, to count the number of successful login events (event ID 4624), you can enter "=COUNTIF(A:A,4624)" in a cell.

    Create a baseline chart: Once you have calculated the counts for each event ID or event source, you can create a baseline chart in Excel to visualize the changes over time. To create a chart, select the cells with the counts, then go to the "Insert" tab and select the chart type that you want to use. For example, you can use a line chart to show the trend of the counts over time.

    Analyze the baseline chart: After creating the baseline chart, you can use it to identify any changes in the Windows event logs over time. For example, if you notice a sudden spike in the number of failed login events, it may indicate a potential security incident that needs further investigation.

In summary, using the COUNTIF function in Excel can help you create event baselines and identify potential security incidents in Windows event logs. By following the steps outlined above, you can filter the logs, use the COUNTIF function to count the occurrences of specific events, create a baseline chart, and analyze the chart to detect any changes over time.

Event ID 4624 is a security event that gets generated in the Microsoft Windows event log every time a user successfully logs on to a computer or server. The event provides important details about the user's logon, such as the user account name, logon type, and logon timestamp.

Logon types are numeric codes that indicate the type of logon that was performed. There are several different logon types, including:

    Interactive (logon at the console of the computer)
    Network (logon via a network connection)
    Batch (logon via a scheduled task)
    Service (logon via a Windows service)
    RemoteInteractive (logon via a Remote Desktop or Terminal Services session)
    CachedInteractive (logon using cached credentials)

The logon type is specified in the event's Logon Type field. Knowing the logon type can help you understand how the user logged on and what resources they may have accessed during their session.

For example, if the logon type is 2, it indicates that the user logged on via a network connection, which could mean that they accessed a network share or used a remote desktop connection. If the logon type is 3, it indicates that the user logged on by means of a batch job or scheduled task.

By reviewing the Event ID 4624 log entries, system administrators can monitor and track user activity on their networks, including identifying suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.

In the Microsoft Windows event log, logon types are numeric codes that indicate the type of logon that was performed. These logon types can help system administrators and security professionals to understand how users are accessing a system and to identify potential security issues.

Here are the different logon types and their corresponding numeric codes:

    Interactive (logon at keyboard and screen): This logon type occurs when a user logs on to a system interactively, by typing their username and password at the keyboard. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 2.

    Network (i.e. connection to shared folder on this computer from elsewhere on network or IIS logon): This logon type occurs when a user accesses resources on a remote system over the network, such as connecting to a shared folder or accessing a web application using IIS. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 3.

    Batch (i.e. scheduled task): This logon type occurs when a scheduled task is executed. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 4.

    Service (Service startup): This logon type occurs when a service is started. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 5.

    RemoteInteractive (Terminal Services, Remote Desktop or Remote Assistance): This logon type occurs when a user connects to a system remotely using a remote desktop or terminal services client. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 10.

    CachedInteractive (logon with cached domain credentials): This logon type occurs when a user logs on to a system using cached domain credentials. This logon type is assigned the numeric code 11.

Understanding the different logon types and their corresponding numeric codes can be useful for monitoring system access, troubleshooting issues, and identifying potential security threats.
==========================================================================================================
#ChatGPT

In Windows Server logs, the Logon Type field indicates the type of logon that was used when a user or a computer logged on to the system. The Logon Type values are defined as follows:

    0: System logon (generated by the system when it starts)
    2: Interactive logon (when a user logs on at the console or through a remote desktop session)
    3: Network logon (when a user logs on to the system over the network)
    4: Batch logon (when a batch job runs on the system)
    5: Service logon (when a service starts and logs on to the system)
    6: Proxy logon (when a service logs on using a proxy account)
    7: Unlock logon (generated when a workstation is unlocked)
    8: Network clear text logon (when a user logs on over the network using clear text authentication)
    9: New credentials logon (when a user reuses an existing token to log on with new credentials)
    10: Remote interactive logon (when a user logs on remotely using Remote Desktop Services)

The logon types are used by Windows to record and track logon activity on the system. They can help administrators to identify the source of logon events and to detect potential security breaches, such as unauthorized logon attempts.

The logon types are also used by some security tools and solutions, such as SIEMs and log management platforms, to analyze and correlate logon events with other security-related events on the system, such as privilege escalation, file access, and network traffic. By understanding the relationships between logon types and other security events, administrators can gain a better understanding of the security posture of their systems and take appropriate actions to protect them from threats.
==========================================================================================================
#ChatGPT

Interactive logon is a logon type in Windows Server logs that indicates when a user logs on to the system at the console or through a remote desktop session. In other words, it refers to the process of logging on to a system by physically or remotely interacting with it.

When a user logs on interactively, they typically provide their username and password to the system. The system then authenticates the user's credentials and creates a new session for the user, which provides access to resources and services on the system.

Interactive logon can occur at the console of the system, which is the physical device that hosts the operating system, or through a remote desktop session, which allows users to connect to the system over a network and interact with it as if they were sitting in front of the console. Remote desktop sessions are typically used for remote administration, remote access to applications, or telecommuting.

Interactive logon is an important logon type to track and monitor in Windows Server logs, as it can indicate when users are accessing the system and what resources and services they are accessing. By analyzing interactive logon events, administrators can identify potential security risks, such as unauthorized access attempts, failed logon attempts, or suspicious activity. They can also use interactive logon events to troubleshoot issues related to user access and session management on the system.

==========================================================================================================
#ChatGPT

The difference between a remote desktop session and Remote Desktop Services (RDS) with respect to the logon types "Interactive logon" and "Remote interactive logon" is as follows:

    Interactive logon: This logon type refers to the process of logging on to a system by physically or remotely interacting with it. When a user logs on interactively, they typically provide their username and password to the system, and a new session is created for them. This type of logon can occur at the console of the system or through a remote desktop session.

    Remote interactive logon: This logon type specifically refers to the process of logging on remotely to a system using Remote Desktop Services (RDS). RDS is a role service in Windows Server that enables users to remotely access Windows-based desktops, applications, and data over a network connection. When a user logs on remotely using RDS, they typically connect to a server that hosts the RDS role service, provide their credentials, and a new session is created for them on the server.

So, the key difference between a remote desktop session and RDS is that the former refers to the general process of accessing a system remotely, while the latter is a specific technology that enables remote access to Windows-based desktops, applications, and data. In terms of logon types, both interactive logon and remote interactive logon involve the creation of a new session for the user, but the latter specifically requires the use of RDS technology to establish the remote connection.

It's worth noting that Remote Desktop Services includes additional logon types beyond Remote interactive logon, such as Remote Desktop Services: Session logon and Remote Desktop Services: Console logon, which are used to differentiate between different types of remote sessions established through RDS.

You can filter security events with ID 4624 that include logon type 10 using Computer Management as follows:

    Open Computer Management: Press Windows key + X, and then click on Computer Management.
    In the console tree, expand "Event Viewer" and then expand "Windows Logs".
    Right-click on "Security" and select "Filter Current Log".
    In the "Filter Current Log" dialog box, click on the "XML" tab.
    In the "XML" tab, check the box for "Edit query manually" and paste the following XML query into the text box:

mathematica

<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Security">
    <Select Path="Security">
      *[System[(EventID=4624)]] and
      *[EventData[Data[@Name='LogonType']='10']]
    </Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>

    Click on "OK" to apply the filter. The Security log will now display only events that match the filter criteria.
