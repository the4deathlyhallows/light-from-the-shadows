Kerberos	88	Authentication, Kerberoasting	EventIDs 4768/4769 in Windows logs; abnormal TGS requests = alert.
DNS	53	C2 communication, data exfiltration	Unusual query patterns or large volumes can indicate tunneling.
HTTP / HTTPS	80 / 443	C2, data exfiltration, download malware	Combine with process creation monitoring; watch for unusual binaries connecting outbound.
SMTPS / SMTP / IMAP	25 / 587 / 993	Exfiltration via mail	Look for unexpected internal-to-external connections.
